Hello! This repo contains several stages of the Tetris game. 
Navigate to the [simple]([url](https://github.com/chloe608/tetris/tree/main/simple)) folder for a working implementation of a simple game of tetris!

To take Tetris a little further, I incorporated Q Learning, a model-less reinforcement learning algorithm into this game. This lets the machine learn better moves as it plays more games.
Files named QLearning have this algorithm embedded, and in QLearningLocalStorage files I've tried to incorporate a local storage system on top of Q Learning to keep track of the machine's past iterations to see if the machine is really learning as it plays!
